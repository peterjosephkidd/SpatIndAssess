    abstract = "{Performance evaluation of data-limited, length-based methods is instrumental in determining and quantifying their accuracy under various scenarios and in providing guidance about model applicability and limitations. We conducted a simulation–estimation analysis to compare the performance of four length-based stock assessment methods: length-based Thompson and Bell (TB), length-based spawning potential ratio (LBSPR), length-based integrated mixed effects (LIME), and length-based risk analysis (LBRA), under varying life history, exploitation status, and recruitment error scenarios. Across all scenarios, TB and LBSPR were the most consistent and accurate assessment methods. LBRA is highly biased, but precautionary, and LIME is more suitable for assessments with time-series longer than a year. All methods have difficulties when assessing short-lived species. The methods are less accurate in estimating the degree of recruitment overfishing when the stocks are severely overexploited, and inconsistent in determining growth overfishing when the stocks are underexploited. Increased recruitment error reduces precision but can decrease bias in estimations. This study highlights the importance of quantifying the accuracy of stock assessment methods and testing methods under different scenarios to determine their strengths and weaknesses and provides guidance on which methods to employ in various situations.}",

abstract = {Abstract The majority of the world's fisheries, by number, are data-poor/limited, and there is a growing body of literature pertaining to approaches to estimate data-limited stock status. There are at least two drivers for assessing the status of data-limited fisheries. The first is to try to understand and report on the global or regional status of fisheries across many stocks. The second is to attempt to assess individual data-limited stocks, for status reporting and/or guiding management decisions. These drivers have led to attempts to find simple, generic, low-cost solutions, including the broad application of generically parameterised models, and the blanket application of a single, or limited number of possible, analytical approach(es). It is unclear that generic methods function as intended, especially when taken out of their original design context or used without care. If the intention is to resolve individual stock status for the purposes of management, there is concern with the indiscriminate application of a single method to a suite of stocks irrespective of the particular circumstances of each. We examine why caution needs to be exercised, and provide guidance on the appropriate application of data-limited assessment methods (DLMs). We recommend: (a) obtaining better data, (b) using care in acknowledging and interpreting uncertainties in the results of DLMs, (c) embedding DLMs in harvest strategies that are robust to the higher levels of uncertainty in the output of DLMs by including precautionary management measures or buffers and (d) selecting and applying DLMs appropriate to specific species’ and fisheries’ data and context.},

	abstract={This paper presents the spatial indicators used in the 
European project FISBOAT. These are statistics intended to capture spatial 
patterns of fish populations, using fish density data collected during 
scientific surveys. To handle diffuse population limits, indicators are 
designed not to depend on arbitrary delineation of the domain. They 
characterize the location (centre of gravity and spatial patches), 
occupation of space (inertia, isotropy, positive area, spreading area and 
equivalent area) and microstructure. Collocation between different 
populations is summarized by a global index of collocation. These spatial 
indicators have the potential to be used in a monitoring system to detect 
changes in spatial distribution. They could be helpful for relating the 
spatial distribution properties of fish stocks to their dynamics, their 
habitats, or to climate change.},

An analysis of traditional catch-at-age data in conjunction with research surveys, which assumed that research survey estimation errors of abundance by age year were independent, led assessment biologist to the conclusion that the collapse was caused by an increase in natural mortality. We construct a statistical model to test the hypothesis that the decline in abundance of cod was caused by a sudden increase in natural mortality in the winter of 1991. The results of the statistical analysis do not support this hypothesis. There is ambiguous evidence that natural mortality has increased since 1991; however, these results are found only in a model which has extraordinary patterns in the residuals. Our analysis suggests that even if natural mortality has been higher in recent years (as estimated using a model with correlated errors for research surveys), that overfishing was sufficiently high to cause a collapse of this population. We also demonstrate the usual assumption that estimation errors from research trawl surveys are independent is not valid, and can lead to invalid inference and unreasonable estimates of abundance.},
